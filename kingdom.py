KING: Do you play?

BALIAN: No.

KING: The whole world is in chess. Any move can be the death of you. Do anything
      except remain where you started and you can't be sure of your end. Were
      you sure of your end once?

BALIAN: I was.

KING: What was it?

BALIAN: To be buried 100 yards from where I was born.

KING: And now?''')
